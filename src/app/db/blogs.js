            A domain is like the address for a website. It's the name you type into your web browser to visit a specific site, like "google.com" or "facebook.com".
            Just like houses in a city can be in different neighborhoods, websites can be in different domains. For example, ".com" is a common neighborhood for businesses, while ".org" is often used by non-profit organizations.
            So, when you hear "domain", think of it as the address that helps you find your way to a website on the internet.`},

This could involve transferring all of the website's files, databases, and settings to a new hosting provider, or upgrading to a new version of a content management system (CMS), like WordPress or Joomla.
            Website migration can be necessary for various reasons, such as improving performance, changing hosting providers, updating technology, or redesigning the website. However, it requires careful planning and execution to ensure that the website remains functional and retains its SEO (Search Engine Optimization) ranking during and after the migration process.`},

            Web hosting is a service provided by companies called web hosts or hosting providers. They have special computers called servers that store your website's files and make them accessible to anyone who wants to visit your site on the internet.
            So, when someone types your website's address into their web browser, their computer connects to the server where your website is hosted, and then your website's files are sent back to their computer, allowing them to see your website.
            In short, web hosting is like renting space on the internet to store your website's files and make your site accessible to visitors.`},
